So far this is a sketch of a working server. Compile with make. Execute 'ircserv 1234 pass'. Open another terminal window, execute 'nc 127.0.0.1 1234' and then type a message. Go back to terminal window where server is running, you should see the message you typed before.TO DO, use poll function to check multiple fds (for multiple connected clients) that might have a POLLIN (read) operation pending
