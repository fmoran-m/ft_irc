So far this is a sketch of a working server. Compile with make. Execute 'ircser 1234 pass'. Open another terminal window, execute 'nc 127.0.0.1 1234' and then type a message. Go back to terminal window where server is running, you should see the message you typed before.
This server sketch calls function accept() to await for the incoming connection. Accept is a blocking function (process remains blocked until a connection is stablished). Our irc server must use non blocking function, so next step is getting rid of accept() and use poll instead.
