Server class in progress. So far it is accepting connections. Compile with make. Execute 'ircserv 1234 pass'. Open another terminal window, connect to the machine and port being listened on by executing 'nc 127.0.0.1 1234' and a new connection is added to Server::fds vector (a message is printed showing ip and port from the connected "client" as well as the fd assigned to this new connection). If you open another terminal window and repeat the operation a new connection ("client") will be added (nc command allows to connect choosing any interface ip in our host by 'nc -s <host interface inet field> 127.0.0.1 1234') . In 42 Madrid computers, besides localhost (127.0.0.1), server will be listening also at 172.17.0.1, 10.12.7.6 and 192.168.122.1 - since listen socket is bound to all available interfaces on the host machine by means of this->serverAddress.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY; in the Server::initSocket() function - (host machine network interfaces can be listed with command ifconfig. see screenshot).

TO DO: start Client class to track every connected "client" (connection).
